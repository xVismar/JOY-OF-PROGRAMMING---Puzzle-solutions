The Airliftcrane is at (0,0,3). You need to figure out the location of the tire, move the crane there and pick it up, then move it back to the crane's starting location. To do that, you need to filter the instruction_sets from the DataExchange to find the correct one. They each consist of movement commands (L = lm left, R = lm right, F = lm forward, Ð’ = lm backward) and a pickup command (P). A correct instruction set will return the Airliftcrane back to (0,0) after pickup.
- Pickup the tire with the Airliftcrane and drop it in the yellow drop zone back at (0,0)
